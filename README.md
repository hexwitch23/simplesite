An evolving website that changes as I learn more code


Boiler Code 
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <html> 
    <head>
      <title> Index </title> 
    </head>
    
    <body>
    </body>
    
  </html>
  
  Additonal HTML attributes 
  
  <img src="">can put text here </img> image code -- can be added to anchor tags
  <br /> line break 
  <p></p> paragraph 
  <ul></ul> unorderd list
  <ol></ol> rdered list 
  <li></li> list items, always need to be nested in ul or ol tags 
  <a></a> is a basic anchor - always needs an attribute to work 
  <a href="">can add text here</a> can also add images inside anchor tags 
  <a href="" <img src=""></a>


CSS NOTES 

CSS can be used in html document but MUST be nested in < head></ head> tag Example:
<head>
<style></style>
</head>

CSS Boiler would look like this 
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <html> 
    <head>
    <style>
    CSS goes here
    </style>
      <title> Index </title> 
    </head>
    
    <body>
    </body>
    
  </html>
  
  Creating anything other than minimal CSS code is INEFFICIENT and CLUNKY - for the best use of CSS and HTML you should create separate files and link them together Consider this 
  HTML is the ARCHITECTRURE of the web page 
  CSS is the PAINT and ADORNMENTS of the web page
